# The Landing Page

It was just an exercise, but it was pretty good. I learn a lot about how to format stuff with Flexbox, even though I struggled during the exercises. So I
guess you should keep trying and you'll probably get what you want. I don't really know much about this stuff. Anyway, I'm kind of proud of this page, despite
its basic look.
